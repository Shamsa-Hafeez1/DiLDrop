This project is based on a single screen maze game where the player has to reach to the end of the maze, meanwhile collecting 2 hearts. Initially only one heart will appear on screen. After collecting that one heart, another heart will appear and the player tends to collect it. It is mandatory to collect the 2 hearts or else the player would not be able to win even after reaching the destination point. Since it is a maze game, the player cannot pass through the maze. 

## Important Points:
-	Visual display of our project is planned to be on a flat panel display (i.e., monitor) using VGA port of BASYS 03 FPGA board.
-	The input peripheral would involve keyboard keys of W, S, D, A to move the player “Up”, “down”, “left” and “right” via which player can easily move the mario around the screen, collect heart and reach to the destination.
- Verilog HDL would be used in order to synthesize and implement all the required logic and processing on BASYS 03 FPGA board.
